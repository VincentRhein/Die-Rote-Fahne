### Media

Poster from the German Democratic Republic on paper.

### Format

42x28.5cm print. Facsimile of it can be a photo like in this case. The poster could be also scanned or the text in the poster can be transcript to a plain text or book. 

### Methodology

The text on the poster is written in german. Furthermore the text is written in fraktur. For my personally this is still readable then but very time consuming and not possible on this image. I am aware that they are not very a "big fan" in handing out posters but in this case it is very difficult and not possible otherwise. I still would like to give it a try if they will hand my out this poster because of the text.

### Preservation
Depending on how much care they take on the poster and the paper is stored with the right light,  temperature and humidity this poster could be preserved for several hundred years. Although the poster was published in 1968 and is already very yellow I assume it was a cheap paper to print a lot of posters.

### About the artefact and how I found it

I found this poster during my research for image class. In my research, for image class I focused on the movement of the Youth Pioneers (Jung Pioniere) and the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend). Both those movements accrued during the time of the German Democratic Republic. I found this poster interesting because of two reasons. First, the red communist flag is very present and impossible to ignore. Making it clear and easy what this text could be standing for. Second, the poster is very informative with a lot of text. During 1949 to 1990 there was no internet and not everyone had a television in there home yet. Therefore to inform the population posters played a way bigger role than in today. The poster was filled with information and communication as much as possible for the people. Today the media can be spread through so many channels and seeing a poster like this is very uncommon.

### About the red flag (Die rote Fahne)
The newspaper Die Rote Fahne was founded on November 9, 1918 by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Berlin - initially as a journalistic organ of the Spartacus League. As a result of the constitution of the German Communist Party (KPD) on January 1, 1919, it was the central organ of the party until 1945. Banned after the end of the Weimar Republic, it was spread underground during the dictatorship of National Socialism under the conditions of illegality in party-close resistance circles.

### The-Spartacus-League

The Spartacus League (German: Spartakusbund) was a Marxist revolutionary movement organized in Germany during World War I. The League was named after Spartacus, leader of the largest slave rebellion of the Roman Republic. It was founded by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin, and others. The League subsequently renamed itself the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD), joining the Comintern in 1919. Its period of greatest activity was during the German Revolution of 1918, when it sought to incite a revolution by circulating the newspaper Spartacus Letters.

### The-Accumulation-of-Capital
In the polemic, Rosa Luxemburg argued that capitalism needs to constantly expand into noncapitalist areas in order to access new supply sources, markets for surplus value, and reservoirs of labor. According to Luxemburg, Marx had made an error in Capital in that the proletariat could not afford to buy the commodities they produced, and therefore by his own criteria it was impossible for capitalists to make a profit in a closed-capitalist system since the demand for commodities would be too low, and therefore much of the value of commodities could not be transformed into money. Therefore, according to Luxemburg, capitalists sought to realize profits through offloading surplus commodities onto non-capitalist economies, hence the phenomenon of imperialism as capitalist states sought to dominate weaker economies. This however lead to the destruction of non-capitalist economies as they were increasingly absorbed into the capitalist system. With the destruction of non-capitalist economies however, there would be no more markets to offload surplus commodities onto, and capitalism would break down.
